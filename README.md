# COMA The Coffee Maker
## Overview

**The Coffee Maker** is a web application that allows people having high competence and strong enthusiasm for the F&B industry to advertise their products, sell them online and look for potential customers. Meanwhile, anyone visiting the website can register for a free account to buy the products offered by the sellers.

This is the project made by me and 5 other friends in the cadre as part of SWP391 subject (Application Developement Project) at FPT University.

## Description
There are 5 actors participated in our system:
- **Guest**: unregistered users. 
- **Customer**: registered users who can purchase items online and have them shipped to home. 
- **Sellers**: registered users who sell their products to the customers. 
- **Shippers**: registered users who act as intermediaries between sellers and customers: receive products from sellers and deliver them to customers.
- **Admin**: the organization leader/manager, acts as the system administrator.

Tech stack used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Java Servlet
- **Database**: MS SQL Server

## What I Learned
The project wouldn't be done completely had it not been for my friends' support and our tremendous teamwork effort. I just feel very lucky to be a part of this team. What's more, I get to know how the system works by applying the Agile methodology, from defining the requirements, designing the wireframes to constantly coding and testing what we have done. Finally, everything has a solution as long as we keep brainstorming, staying self-controlled and counting on what we are doing.

I have never learned such a huge knowledge of web application until I get my hands dirty with this project. This is just the beginning, but I'll constantly push myself forward and have a clear mind to welcome other challenges ahead.
